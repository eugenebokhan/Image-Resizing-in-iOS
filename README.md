# Image Resizing on iOS

This repo contains a source code of tests I used for performance and quality characteristics measurements of different image resizing techniques on iOS).

**Note**: the *quality* tests outputs contain `MTLTextures`, I recommend to use [`MTLTextureViewer`](https://github.com/eugenebokhan/MTLTextureViewer) for previewing them.
